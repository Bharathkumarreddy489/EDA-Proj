# GDP Analysis from 1960 to 2016

## Overview

This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the GDP data from 1960 to 2016. The analysis explores GDP growth trends, country-wise GDP comparisons, and visualizes the data through various plots to uncover insights and patterns in the global economic landscape.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is a CSV file containing GDP data for various countries from 1960 to 2016. The columns include:
- `Country Name`: Name of the country
- `Country Code`: ISO code of the country
- `Year`: Year of the data
- `Value`: GDP value

## File Structure

- `gdp.csv`: The dataset file.
- `gdp_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Importing Required Libraries

Libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and plotly are imported for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### 2. Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded using pandas.

### 3. Initial Data Exploration

- Display the first five rows of the dataset.
- Check for null values.
- Describe each column (`Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Year`).

### 4. Analyzing Specific Countries

- Analyze the GDP trends for specific countries like the Arab World and World.
- Calculate the GDP growth rate for countries.
- Visualize the GDP growth over the years using line plots.

### 5. Country-Wise GDP Growth

- Calculate and visualize the GDP growth for each country over the years.
- Create individual GDP analysis plots for each country.

### 6. GDP Comparison

- Compare GDP trends between specific countries (e.g., India and China).
- Compare GDP trends among multiple countries (e.g., USA, China, India, Italy).

### 7. Detailed Visualizations

- Create line plots to visualize GDP trends for all countries.
- Generate HTML files for individual country GDP analyses.
- Generate HTML files for GDP comparisons among selected countries.
- Create and visualize GDP growth comparison plots for all countries.

## Visualizations

The analysis includes various visualizations such as:

- Line plots for individual countries' GDP trends.
- GDP growth rate plots for specific and multiple countries.
- Comparative GDP analysis between different countries.
- Comprehensive GDP growth plots for all countries from 1960 to 2016.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the exploratory data analysis of GDP from 1960 to 2016 revealed consistent global economic growth, with notable variations among countries. Emerging economies like China and India exhibited significant growth, while developed nations showed steadier trajectories. Visualizations were instrumental in understanding GDP trends, and comparative analyses highlighted diverse economic landscapes. This underscores the importance of ongoing economic monitoring for informed decision-making and sustainable development.
